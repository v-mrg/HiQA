To the extent practicable, the device under test shall be measured at the distance specified in the appropriate rule section. The distance specified corresponds to the horizontal distance between the measurement antenna and the closest point of the equipment under test, support equipment or interconnecting cables as determined by the boundary defined by an imaginary straight line periphery describing a simple geometric configuration enclosing the system containing the equipment under test. The equipment under test, support equipment and any interconnecting cables shall be included within this boundary.

# 4. Measurement Procedures
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Measurement Procedures [desc]

# 4.1. Above 30 MHz
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Measurement Procedures __ Above 30 MHz [desc]
At frequencies at or above 30 MHz, measurements may be performed at a distance other than what is specified provided: measurements are not made in the near field except where it can be shown that near field measurements are appropriate due to the characteristics of the device; and it can be demonstrated that the signal levels needed to be measured at the distance employed can be detected by the measurement equipment. Measurements shall not be performed at a distance greater than 30 meters unless it can be further demonstrated that measurements at a distance of 30 meters or less are impractical. When performing measurements at a distance other than that specified, the results shall be extrapolated to the specified distance using an extrapolation factor of 20 dB/decade (inverse linear-distance for field strength measurements; inverse-linear-distance-squared for power density measurements).

# 4.2. Below 30 MHz
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Measurement Procedures __ Below 30 MHz [desc]
At frequencies below 30 MHz, measurements may be performed at a distance closer than that specified in the regulations; however, an attempt should be made to avoid making measurements in the near field. Pending the development of an appropriate measurement procedure for measurements performed below 30 MHz, when performing measurements at a closer distance than specified, the results shall be extrapolated to the specified distance by either making measurements at a minimum of two distances on at least one radial to determine the proper extrapolation factor or by using the square of an inverse linear distance extrapolation factor (40 dB/decade). This paragraph shall not apply to Access BPL devices operating below 30 MHz.

# 4.3. For Access BPL Devices
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Measurement Procedures __ For Access BPL Devices [desc]
For Access BPL devices operating below 30 MHz, measurements shall be performed at the 30-meter reference distance specified in the regulations whenever possible. Measurements may be performed at a distance closer than that specified in the regulations if circumstances such as high ambient noise levels or geographic limitations are present. When performing measurements at a distance which is closer than specified, the field strength results shall be extrapolated to the specified distance.# 3. For Access BPL devices operating below 30 MHz
For Access BPL devices operating below 30 MHz, measurements shall be performed at the 30-meter reference distance specified in the regulations whenever possible. Measurements may be performed at a distance closer than that specified in the regulations if circumstances such as high ambient noise levels or geographic limitations are present. When performing measurements at a distance which is closer than specified, the field strength results shall be extrapolated to the specified distance by using the square of an inverse linear distance extrapolation factor (i.e., 40 dB/decade) in conjunction with the slant-range distance defined in § 15.3(hh) of this part. As an alternative, a site-specific extrapolation factor derived from a straight line best fit of measurements of field strength in dBµV/m vs. logarithmic distance in meters for each carrier frequency, as determined by a linear least squares regression calculation from measurements for at least four distances from the power line, may be used. Compliance measurements for Access BPL and the use of site-specific extrapolation factors shall be made in accordance with the Measurement Guidelines for Access BPL systems specified by the Commission. Site-specific determination of the distance extrapolation factor shall not be used at locations where a ground conductor is present within 30 meters if the Access BPL signals are on the neutral/grounded line of a power system.

# 4. The applicant for a grant of certification
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ The applicant for a grant of certification [desc]
The applicant for a grant of certification shall specify the extrapolation method used in the application filed with the Commission. For equipment subject to Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity, this information shall be retained with the measurement data.

# 5. When measurement distances of 30 meters or less are specified
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ When measurement distances of 30 meters or less are specified [desc]
When measurement distances of 30 meters or less are specified in the regulations, the Commission will test the equipment at the distance specified unless measurement at that distance results in measurements being performed in the near field. When measurement distances of greater than 30 meters are specified in the regulations, the Commission will test the equipment at a closer distance, usually 30 meters, extrapolating the measured field strength to the specified distance using the methods shown in this section.

# 6. Measurements shall be performed at a sufficient number of radials
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Measurements shall be performed at a sufficient number of radials [desc]
Measurements shall be performed at a sufficient number of radials around the equipment under test to determine the radial at which the field strength values of the radiated emissions are maximized. The maximum field strength at the frequency being measured shall be reported in the equipment authorization report. This paragraph shall not apply to Access BPL equipment on overhead medium voltage lines. In lieu thereof, the measurement guidelines established by the Commission for Access BPL shall be followed.

# 7. Equipment under test shall be positioned and adjusted
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Equipment under test shall be positioned and adjusted [desc]
Equipment under test shall be positioned and adjusted, using those controls that are readily accessible to or are intended to be accessible to the consumer, in such a manner as to maximize the level of the emissions. For those devices to which wire leads may be attached by the operator, tests shall be performed with wire leads attached. The wire leads shall be of the length to be used with the equipment if that length is known. Otherwise, wire leads one meter in length shall be attached to the equipment. Longer wire leads may be employed if necessary to interconnect to associated peripherals.# 15.31 Federal Communications Commission
Equipment under test shall be positioned and adjusted, using those controls that are readily accessible to or are intended to be accessible to the consumer, in such a manner as to maximize the level of the emissions.

The wire leads shall be of the length to be used with the equipment if that length is known. Otherwise, wire leads one meter in length shall be attached to the equipment. Longer wire leads may be employed if necessary to interconnect to associated peripherals.
(h) A composite system, as defined in § 2.947(f) of this chapter, that incorporates a carrier current system shall be tested as if the carrier current system were incorporated in a separate device; that is, the device shall be tested for compliance with whatever rules would apply to the device were the carrier current system not incorporated, and the carrier current system shall be tested for compliance with the rules applicable to carrier current systems.
(i) If the device under test provides for the connection of external accessories, including external electrical input signals, the device shall be tested with the accessories attached. The device under test shall be fully exercised with these external accessories. The emission tests shall be performed with the device and accessories configured in a manner that tends to produce maximized emissions within the range of variations that can be expected under normal operating conditions. In the case of multiple accessory external ports, an external accessory shall be connected to one of each type of port. Only one test using peripherals or external accessories that are representative of the devices that will be employed with the equipment under test is required. All possible equipment combinations do not need to be tested. The accessories or peripherals connected to the device being tested shall be unmodified, commercially available equipment.
(j) If the equipment under test consists of a central control unit and an external or internal accessory(ies) (peripheral) and the party declaring compliance of the equipment or applying for a grant of equipment authorization manufactures or assembles the central control unit and at least one of the accessory devices that can be used with that control unit, testing of the control unit and/or the accessory(ies) must be performed using the devices manufactured or assembled by that party, in addition to any other needed devices which the party does not manufacture or assemble. If the party declaring compliance of the equipment or applying for a grant of equipment authorization does not manufacture or assemble the central control unit and at least one of the accessory devices that can be used with that control unit or the party can demonstrate that the central control unit or accessory(ies) normally would be marketed or used with equipment from a different entity, testing of the central control unit and/or the accessory(ies) must be performed using the specific combination of equipment which is intended to be marketed or used together. Only one test using peripherals or accessories that are representative of the devices that will be employed with the equipment under test is required. All possible equipment combinations do not need to be tested.# 1. Accessory Devices Testing Requirements
At least one of the accessory devices that can be used with that control unit or the party can demonstrate that the central control unit or accessory(ies) normally would be marketed or used with equipment from a different entity, testing of the central control unit and/or the accessory(ies) must be performed using the specific combination of equipment which is intended to be marketed or used together. Only one test using peripherals or accessories that are representative of the devices that will be employed with the equipment under test is required. All possible equipment combinations are not required to be tested. The accessories or peripherals connected to the device being tested shall be unmodified, commercially available equipment.

# 2. Composite Systems
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Composite Systems [desc]
(k) Composite systems (i.e., systems that incorporate different devices contained in a single enclosure or in separate enclosures connected by wire or cable) shall be measured for compliance with the technical standards of this part in accordance with the procedures in § 2.947(f) of this chapter. For digital devices that consist of a combination of Class A and Class B devices, the total combination of which results in a Class A digital device, it is only necessary to demonstrate that the equipment combination complies with the limits for a Class A device. This equipment combination may not be employed for obtaining a grant of equipment authorization or declaring compliance of a Class B digital device. However, if the digital device combination consists of a Class B central control unit, e.g., a personal computer, and a Class A internal peripheral(s), it must be demonstrated that the Class B central control unit continues to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device with the Class A internal peripheral(s) installed but not active.

[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ q(1) [desc]
An LPR device intended for installation inside metal and concrete enclosures may show compliance for radiated emissions when measured outside a representative enclosure with the LPR installed inside, in accordance with the measurement guidelines established by the Commission for these devices. LPR devices operating inside these types of enclosures shall ensure that the enclosure is closed when the radar device is operating. Care shall be taken to ensure that gaskets, flanges, and other openings are sealed to eliminate signal leakage outside of the structure. The responsible party shall take reasonable steps to ensure that LPR devices intended for use in these types of enclosures shall not be installed in open-air environments or inside enclosures with lower radio-frequency attenuating characteristics (e.g., fiberglass, plastic, etc.). An LPR device approved under this subsection may only be operated in the type of enclosure for which it was approved.

(5) If the intentional radiator contains a digital device, regardless of whether this digital device controls the functions of the intentional radiator or the digital device is used for additional control or function purposes other than to enable the operation of the intentional radiator, the frequency range shall be investigated up to the range specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section or the range applicable to the digital device, as shown in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, whichever is the higher frequency range of investigation. 
(b) For unintentional radiators: 
(1) Except as otherwise indicated in paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, for an unintentional radiator, including a digital device, the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency signal generated or used in the device, without going below the lowest frequency for which a radiated emission limit is specified, up to the frequency shown in the following table:

(3) Except for a CB receiver, a receiver employing superheterodyne techniques shall be investigated from 30 MHz up to at least the second harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the device. If such a receiver is controlled by a digital device, the frequency range shall be investigated up to the higher of the second harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the device or the upper frequency of the measurement range specified for the digital device in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
(c) The above-specified frequency ranges of measurements apply to the measurement of radiated emissions and, in the case of receivers, the measurement to demonstrate compliance with the antenna conduction limits specified in § 15.111. The frequency range of measurements for AC power line conducted limits is specified in §§ 15.107 and 15.207 and applies to all equipment subject.# § 15.35 Measurement detector functions and bandwidths.
The conducted and radiated emission limits shown in this part are based on the following, unless otherwise specified in this part: 
(a) On any frequency or frequencies below or equal to 1000 MHz, the limits shown are based on measuring equipment employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector function and related measurement bandwidths, unless otherwise specified. The specifications for the measuring instrumentation using the CISPR quasi-peak detector can be found in ANSI C63.4–2014, clause 4 (incorporated by reference, see § 15.38). As an alternative to CISPR quasi-peak measurements, the responsible party, at its option, may demonstrate compliance with the emission limits using measuring equipment employing a peak detector function as long at the same bandwidth as indicated for CISPR quasi-peak measurements are employed. 
(b) Unless otherwise specified, on any frequency or frequencies above 1000 MHz, the radiated emission limits are based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing an average detector function. Unless otherwise specified, measurements above 1000 MHz shall be performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz. When average radiated emission measurements are specified in this part, including average emission measurements below 1000 MHz, there also is a limit on the peak level of the radio frequency emissions. Unless otherwise specified, e.g., see §§ 15.250, 15.252, 15.253(d), 15.255, 15.256, and 15.509 through 15.519, the limit on peak radio frequency emissions is 20 dB above the maximum permitted average emission limit applicable to the equipment under test. This peak limit applies to the total peak emission level radiated by the device, e.g., the total peak power level. Note that the use of a pulse desensitization correction factor may be needed to determine the total peak emission level. The instruction manual or application note for the measurement instrument should be consulted for determining pulse desensitization factors, as necessary. 
(c) Unless otherwise specified, e.g., §§ 15.255 and 15.256(l)(5), when the radiated emission limits are expressed in terms of the average value of the emission, and pulsed operation is employed, the measurement field strength shall be determined b# § 15.37 Transition provisions for compliance with this part

(b) In the emission table above, the tighter limit applies at the band edges. (c) The level of any unwanted emissions from an intentional radiator operating under these general provisions shall not exceed the level of the fundamental emission. For intentional radiators which operate under the provisions of other sections within this part and which are required to reduce their unwanted emissions to the limits specified in this table, the limits in this table are based on the frequency of the unwanted emission and not the fundamental frequency. However, the level of any unwanted emissions shall not exceed the level of the fundamental frequency. (d) The emission limits shown in the above table are based on measurements employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector except for the frequency bands 9–90 kHz, 110–490 kHz and above 1000 MHz. Radiated emission limits in these three bands are based on measurements employing an average detector. (e) The provisions in §§ 15.31, 15.33, and 15.35 for measuring emissions at distances other than the distances specified in the above table, determining the frequency range over which radiated emissions are to be measured, and limiting peak emissions apply to all devices operated under this part. (f) In accordance with § 15.33(a), in some cases the emissions from an intentional radiator must be measured to beyond the tenth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency designed to be emitted by the intentional radiator because of the incorporation of a digital device. If measurements above the tenth harmonic are so required, the radiated emissions above the tenth harmonic shall comply with the general radiated emission limits applicable to the incorporated digital device, as shown in § 15.109 and as based on the frequency of the emission being measured, or, except for emissions contained in the restricted frequency bands shown in § 15.205, the limit on spurious emissions specified for the intentional radiator, whichever is the higher limit. Emissions which must be measured above the tenth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency designed to be emitted by the intentional radiator and which fall within the restricted bands shall comply with the general radiated emission limits in § 15.109 that are applicable to the incorporated digital device. (g) Perimeter protection systems may operate in the 54–72 MHz and 76–88 MHz bands under the provisions of this section. The use of such perimeter protection systems is limited to industrial, business and commercial applications.

Access to the telephone network shall occur only if the code transmitted by the handset matches code set in the base unit. Similarly, ringing of the handset shall occur only if the code transmitted by the base unit matches the code set in the handset. The security code required by this section may also be employed to perform other communications func- tions, such as providing telephone bill- ing information. This security code system is to operate in accordance with the following provisions. 
(1) There must be provision for at least 256 possible discrete digital codes. Factory-set codes must be continu- ously varied over at least 256 possible codes as each telephone is manufac- tured. The codes may be varied either randomly, sequentially, or using an- other systematic procedure. 
(2) Manufacturers must use one of the following approaches for facili- tating variation in the geographic dis- tribution of individual security codes: 
(i) Provide a means for the user to readily select from among at least 256 possible discrete digital codes. The cordless telephone shall be either in a non-operable mode after manufacture until the user selects a security code or the manufacturer must continuously vary the initial security code as each telephone is produced. 
(ii) Provide a fixed code that is con- tinuously varied among at least 256 dis- crete digital codes as each telephone is manufactured. 
(iii) Provide a means for the cordless telephone to automatically select a different code from among at least 256 possible discrete digital codes each time it is activated. 
(iv) It is permissible to provide com- binations of fixed, automatic, and user- selectable coding provided the above criteria are met. 
(3) A statement of the means and pro- cedures used to achieve the required protection shall be provided in any ap- plication for equipment authorization of a cordless telephone.

All emissions at and below 960 MHz are based on measurements employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector. Unless otherwise specified, all RMS average emission levels specified in this section are to be measured utilizing a 1 MHz resolution bandwidth with a one millisecond dwell over each 1 MHz segment. The frequency span of the analyzer should equal the number of sampling bins times 1 MHz and the sweep rate of the analyzer should equal the number of sampling bins times one millisecond. The provision in § 15.35(c) that allows emissions to be averaged over a 100 millisecond period does not apply to devices operating under this section. The video bandwidth of the measurement instrument shall not be less than the resolution bandwidth and trace averaging shall not be employed. The RMS average emission measurement is to be repeated over multiple sweeps with the analyzer set for maximum hold until the amplitude stabilizes.

Asynchronous devices. Devices that transmit RF energy at irregular time intervals, as typified by local area net- work data systems. 
Emission bandwidth. For purposes of this subpart the emission bandwidth shall be determined by measuring the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center fre- quency, that are 26 dB down relative to the maximum level of the modulated carrier. Compliance with the emissions limits is based on the use of measure- ment instrumentation employing a peak detector function with an instru- ment resolutions bandwidth approxi- mately equal to 1.0 percent of the emis- sion bandwidth of the device under measurement. 
Isochronous devices. Devices that transmit at a regular interval, typified by time-division voice systems. 
Peak transmit power. The peak power output as measured over an interval of time equal to the frame rate or trans- mission burst of the device under all conditions of modulation. Usually this parameter is measured as a conducted emission by direct connection of a cali- brated test instrument to the equip- ment under test. If the device cannot be connected directly, alternative tech- niques acceptable to the Commission may be used.

(c) Peak transmit power shall not exceed 100 microwatts multiplied by the square root of the emission bandwidth in hertz. Peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the channel.

Table tile: Monitoring Criteria
| Criterion | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 1 | Immediately prior to initiating transmission, devices must monitor the combined time and spectrum windows in which they intend to transmit for a period of at least 10 milliseconds for systems designed to use a 10 milliseconds or shorter frame period or at least 20 milliseconds for systems designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period. |
| 2 | The monitoring threshold must not be more than 30 dB above the thermal noise power for a bandwidth equivalent to the emission bandwidth used by the device. |
| 3 | If no signal above the threshold level is detected, transmission may commence and continue with the same emission bandwidth |
---table end---

# Federal Communications Commission § 15.323
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ 323 [desc]
(2) The monitoring threshold must not be more than 30 dB above the thermal noise power for a bandwidth equivalent to the emission bandwidth used by the device. 
(3) If no signal above the threshold level is detected, transmission may commence and continue with the same emission bandwidth in the monitored time and spectrum windows without further monitoring. However, occupation of the same combined time and spectrum windows by a device or group of cooperating devices continuously over a period of time longer than 8 hours is not permitted without repeating the access criteria. 
(4) Once access to specific combined time and spectrum windows is obtained an acknowledgment from a system participant must be received by the initiating transmitter within one second or transmission must cease. Periodic acknowledgments must be received at least every 30 seconds or transmission must cease. Channels used exclusively for control and signaling information may transmit continuously for 30 seconds without receiving an acknowledgment, at which time the access criteria must be repeated. 
(5) If access to spectrum is not available as determined by the above, and a minimum of 20 duplex system access channels are defined for the system, the time and spectrum windows with the lowest power level may be accessed. A device utilizing the provisions of this paragraph must have monitored all access channels defined for its system within the last 10 seconds and must verify, within the 20 milliseconds (40 milliseconds for devices designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period) immediately preceding actual channel access that the detected power of the selected time and spectrum windows is no higher than the previously detected value. The power measurement resolution for this comparison must be accurate to within 6 dB. No device or group of co-operating devices located within 1 meter of each other shall during any frame period occupy more than 6 MHz of aggregate bandwidth, or alternatively, more than one third of the time and spectrum windows defined by the system. 
(6) If the selected combined time and spectrum windows are unavailable, the device may either monitor and select different windows or seek to use the same windows after waiting an amount of time, randomly chosen from a uniform random distribution between 10 and 150 milliseconds, commencing when the channel becomes available. 
(7) The monitoring system bandwidth must be equal to or greater than the emission bandwidth of the intended transmission and have a maximum reaction time less than 50xSQRT (1.25/ emission bandwidth in MHz) microseconds for signals at the applicable threshold level but shall not be required to be less than 50 microseconds. If a signal is detected that is 6 dB or more above the applicable threshold level, the maximum reaction time shall be 35xSQRT (1.25/emission bandwidth in MHz) microseconds but shall not be required to be less than 35 microseconds. 
(8) The monitoring system shall use the same antenna used for transmission, or an antenna that yields equivalent reception at that location. 
(9) Devices that have a power output lower than the maximum permitted under this subpart m# 8. Monitoring System Requirements
The monitoring system shall use the same antenna used for transmission, or an antenna that yields equivalent reception at that location.

# 9. Power Output Adjustment
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Power Output Adjustment [desc]
Devices that have a power output lower than the maximum permitted under this subpart may increase their monitoring detection threshold by one decibel for each one decibel that the transmitter power is below the maximum permitted.

# 10. Duplex Connection Initiation
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Duplex Connection Initiation [desc]
An initiating device may attempt to establish a duplex connection by monitoring both its intended transmit and receive time and spectrum windows. If both the intended transmit and receive time and spectrum windows meet the access criteria, then the initiating device can initiate a transmission in the intended transmit time and spectrum window. If the power detected by the responding device can be decoded as a duplex connection signal from the initiating device, then the responding device may immediately begin transmitting on the receive time and spectrum window monitored by the initiating device.

# 11. Monitoring During Transmit Window
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Monitoring During Transmit Window [desc]
An initiating device that is prevented from monitoring during its intended transmit window due to monitoring system blocking from the transmissions of a co-located (within one meter) transmitter of the same system, may monitor the portions of the time and spectrum windows in which they intend to receive over a period of at least 10 milliseconds. The monitored time and spectrum window must total at least 50 percent of the 10 millisecond frame interval and the monitored spectrum must be within 1.25 MHz of the center frequency of channel(s) already occupied by that device or co-located co-operating devices. If the access criteria is met for the intended receive time and spectrum window under the above conditions, then transmission in the intended transmit window by the initiating device may commence.

# 12. Spectrum Fair Access
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Spectrum Fair Access [desc]
The provisions of (c)(10) or (c)(11) of this section shall not be used to extend the range of spectrum occupied over space or time for the purpose of denying fair access to spectrum to other devices.

Emissions outside the band shall be attenuated below a reference power of 112 milliwatts as follows: 30 dB between the band and 1.25 MHz above or below the band; 50 dB between 1.25 and 2.5 MHz above or below the band; and 60 dB at 2.5 MHz or greater above or below the band. Emissions inside the band must comply with the following emission mask: In the bands between 1B and 2B measured from the center of the emission bandwidth the total power emitted by the device shall be at least 30 dB below the transmit power permitted for that device; in the bands between 2B and 3B measured from the center of the emission bandwidth the total power emitted by an intentional radiator shall be at least 50 dB below the transmit power permitted for that radiator; in the bands between 3B and the band edge the total power emitted by an intentional radiator in the measurement bandwidth shall be at least 60 dB below the transmit power permitted.# Subpart E—Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure Devices

U–NII devices operating with any part of its 26 dB emission bandwidth in the 5.25–5.35 GHz and 5.47–5.725 GHz bands shall employ a DFS radar detection mechanism to detect the presence of radar systems and to avoid co-channel operation with radar systems. Operators shall only use equipment with a DFS mechanism that is turned on when operating in these bands. The device must sense for radar signals at 100 percent of its emission bandwidth. The minimum DFS detection threshold for devices with a maximum e.i.r.p. of 200 mW to 1 W is ¥64 dBm. For devices that operate with less than 200 mW e.i.r.p. and a power spectral density of less than 10 dBm in a 1 MHz band, the minimum detection threshold is ¥62 dBm.

(iii) Channel Move Time. After a radar’s presence is detected, all transmissions shall cease on the operating channel within 10 seconds. Transmissions during this period shall consist of normal traffic for a maximum of 200 ms after detection of the radar signal. In addition, intermittent management and control signals can be sent during the remaining time to facilitate vacating the operating channel. (iv) Non-occupancy Period. A channel that has been flagged as containing a radar system, either by a channel availability check or in-service monitoring, is subject to a non-occupancy period of at least 30 minutes. The non-occupancy period starts at the time when the radar system is detected.

However, if detailed local information is not available, the ‘‘Village Centre’’ clutter category should be used. The AFC system must use 1 arc-second digital elevation terrain data and, for locations where such data is not available, the most granular available digital elevation terrain data.

[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ 503 Definitions [desc]
(a) UWB bandwidth. For the purpose of this subpart, the UWB bandwidth is the frequency band bounded by the points that are 10 dB below the highest radiated emission, as based on the complete transmission system including the antenna. The upper boundary is designated fH and the lower boundary is designated fL. The frequency at which the highest radiated emission occurs is designated fM.  
(b) Center frequency. The center frequency, fC, equals (fH + fL)/2.  
(c) Fractional bandwidth. The fractional bandwidth equals 2(fH-fL)/ (fH + fL).  
(d) Ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter. An intentional radiator that, at any point in time, has a fractional bandwidth equal to or greater than 0.20 or has a UWB bandwidth equal to or greater than 500 MHz, regardless of the fractional bandwidth.  
(e) Imaging system. A general category consisting of ground penetrating radar systems, medical imaging systems, wall imaging systems, through-wall imaging systems and surveillance systems. As used in this subpart, imaging systems do not include systems designed to detect the location of tags or systems used to transfer voice or data information.  
(f) Ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. A field disturbance sensor that is designed to operate only when in contact with, or within one meter of, the ground for the purpose of detecting or obtaining the images of buried objects or determining the physical properties within the ground. The energy from the GPR is intentionally directed down into the ground for this purpose.

(2) Reference datum. All geographic coordinates shall be referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
(c) Requirements for fixed white space devices. (1) The geographic coordinates of a fixed white space device shall be determined at the time of installation and first activation from a power off condition by an incorporated geo-location capability. The antenna height above ground shall be determined by the installer or operator of the device, or by an automatic means. This information shall be stored internally in the white space device and transmitted automatically by the device to the white space database. The operator of a fixed white space device shall be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the information registered in the white space database. If a fixed white space device is moved to another location or if its stored coordinates become altered, the operator shall reestablish the device’s:
(i) Geographic location through the incorporated geo-location capability and the antenna height above ground level and store this information in the white space device; and
(ii) Registration with the database based# Fixed White Space Device Operations
nsmitted 
automatically by the device to the 
white space database. The operator of a 
fixed white space device shall be re-
sponsible for assuring the accuracy of 
the information registered in the white 
space database. If a fixed white space 
device is moved to another location or 
if its stored coordinates become al-
tered, the operator shall reestablish 
the device’s: 
(i) Geographic location through the 
incorporated 
geo-location 
capability 
and the antenna height above ground 
level and store this information in the 
white space device; and 
(ii) Registration with the database 
based on the device’s new coordinates 
and antenna height above ground level. 
(iii) A fixed white space device may 
obtain 
its 
geographic 
coordinates 
through 
an 
external 
geo-location 
source when it is used at a location 
where its internal geo-location capa-
bility does not function. An external 
geo-location source may be connected 
to a fixed device through either a wired 
or a wireless connection, and a single 
geo-location source may provide loca-
tion information to multiple fixed de-
vices. An external geo-location source 
must be connected to a fixed device 
using a secure connection that ensures 
that only an external geo-location 
source that has been approved with a 
particular fixed device can provide geo-
graphic coordinates to that device. The 
geographic coordinates must be pro-
vided automatically by the external 
geo-location source to the fixed device; 
users may not manually enter them. 
Alternatively, an extender cable may 
be used to connect a remote receive an-
tenna to a geo-location receiver within 
a fixed device. 
(iv) The applicant for certification of 
a fixed device must demonstrate the 
accuracy of the geo-location method 
used and the location uncertainty as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section. 
For fixed devices that are not using an 
internal geo-location capability, this 
uncertainty must account for the accu-
racy of the geo-location source and the 
separation 
distance 
between 
such 
source and the white space device.

prior to its initial service transmission 
at a given location. 
(ii) Operation is permitted only on 
channels and at power levels that are 
indicated in the database as being 
available for each white space device. 
Operation on a channel must cease im-
mediately or power must be reduced to 
a permissible level if the database indi-
cates that the channel is no longer 
available at the current operating 
level. 
(iii) A fixed white space device shall 
access the database at least as fre-
quently as specified in paragraph (h) of 
this section to verify that the oper-
ating 
channel(s) 
and 
corresponding 
power levels continue to remain avail-
able. The fixed device’s registration in-

power levels continue to remain available. The fixed device’s registration information shall be updated if the geographic coordinates reported to the 
database differ by more than ±50 meters from the previously registered coordinates. 
(iv) Fixed devices without a direct 
connection to the Internet: A fixed 
white space device may not operate on 
channels provided by a white space 
database for another fixed device. A 
fixed white space device that has not 
yet been initialized and registered with 
a white space database consistent with 
§ 15.713 of this part, but can receive the 
transmissions of another fixed white 
space device, may transmit to that 
other fixed white space device on either a channel that the other white 
space device has transmitted on or on a 
channel which the other white space 
device indicates is available for use to 
access the database to register its location and receive a list of channels that 
are available for it to use. Subsequently, the newly registered fixed 
white space device must only use the 
channels that the database indicates 
are available for it to use. 

# Mode II Personal/Portable White Space Device Requirements
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Narrowband White Space Devices __ Mode II Personal/Portable White Space Device Requirements [desc]
(d) Requirements for Mode II personal/ 
portable white space devices. (1) The geographic coordinates of a Mode II personal/portable white space device shall 
be determined by an incorporated geolocation capability prior to its initial 
service transmission at a given location and each time the device is activated from a power-off condition to determine the available channels and the 
corresponding 
maximum 
permitted 
power for each available channel at its 
geographic coordinates, taking into 
consideration the device’s geolocation 
uncertainty. The location must be 
checked at least once every 60 seconds 
while in operation, except while in 
sleep mode, i.e., in a mode in which the 
device is inactive but is not powered- 
down. 
(2) Each Mode II personal/portable 
white space device must access a white 
space database over the Internet to obtain a list of available channels for its 
location. The device must access the 
database for an updated available channel list if its location changes by more 
than 100 meters from the location at 
which it last established its available 
channel list. 
(3) Operation is permitted only on 
channels and at power levels that are 
indicated in the database as being 
available for the Mode II personal/portable white space device. Operation on a 
channel must cease immediately or 
power must be reduced to a permissible 
level if the database indicates that the 
channel is no longer available at the 
current operating level. 
(4) A Mode II personal/portable white 
space device that has been in a powered 
state shall re-check its location and access the database at least as frequently 
as specified in paragraph (h) of this section to verify that the operating channel(s) and corresponding power levels 
continue to be available. 
(5) A Mode II personal/portable device 
may load channel availability information for multiple locations, (i.e., in the 
vicinity of its current location) and use 
that information to define a geographic 
area within which it can operate on the 
same available channels at all locations. For example, a Mode II personal/portable white space device could calculate a bounded a# 5. Requirements for Mode II and Mode I Devices
check its location and access the database at least as frequently as specified in paragraph (h) of this section to verify that the operating channel(s) and corresponding power levels continue to be available.
(5) A Mode II personal/portable device may load channel availability information for multiple locations, (i.e., in the vicinity of its current location) and use that information to define a geographic area within which it can operate on the same available channels at all locations. For example, a Mode II personal/portable white space device could calculate a bounded area in which a channel or channels are available at all locations within the area and operate on a mobile basis within that area. A Mode II white space device using such channel availability information for multiple locations must contact the database again if/when it moves beyond the boundary of the area where the channel availability data is valid.

# 5.1. Mode I Device Operational Conditions
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Narrowband White Space Devices __ Mode I Device Operational Conditions [desc]
(e) Requirements for Mode I personal/portable white space devices. (1) A Mode I personal/portable white space device may only transmit upon receiving a list of available channels from a fixed or Mode II white space device. A fixed or Mode II white space device may provide a Mode I device with a list of available channels only after it contacts its database, provides the database the FCC Identifier (FCC ID) of the Mode I device requesting available channels, and receives verification that the FCC ID is valid for operation.
(2) A Mode II device must provide a list of channels to the Mode I device that is the same as the list of channels available to the Mode II device.
(3) A fixed device may provide a list of available channels to a Mode I device only if the fixed device HAAT as verified by the white space database does not exceed 106 meters. The fixed device must provide a list of available channels to the Mode I device that is the same as the list of channels available to the fixed device, except that a Mode I device may operate only on those channels that are permissible for its use under § 15.707 of this part. A fixed device may also obtain from a white space database and provide to a Mode I personal/portable white space device, a separate list of available channels that includes adjacent channels available to a Mode I personal/portable white space device, but not a fixed white space device.
(4) To initiate contact with a fixed or Mode II device, a Mode I device may transmit on an available channel used by the fixed or Mode II white space device or on a channel the fixed or Mode II white space device indicates is available for use by a Mode I device. At least once every 60 seconds, except when in sleep mode (i.e., a mode in which the device is inactive but is not powered-down), a Mode I device must either receive a contact verification signal from the Mode II or fixed white space device that provided its current list of available channels or contact a Mode II or fixed white space device to re-verify/re-establish channel availability. A Mode I device must cease operation immediately if it does not receive a contact verification signal or is not able to re-establish a list of available channels through contact with a fixed or Mode II device on this schedule. If a fixed or Mode II white space device loses power and# 1. Mode I Device Requirements 
Inactive but is not powered-down, a Mode I device must either receive a contact verification signal from the Mode II or fixed white space device that provided its current list of available channels or contact a Mode II or fixed white space device to re-verify/re-establish channel availability. A Mode I device must cease operation immediately if it does not receive a contact verification signal or is not able to re-establish a list of available channels through contact with a fixed or Mode II device on this schedule. If a fixed or Mode II white space device loses power and obtains a new channel list, it must signal all Mode I devices it is serving to acquire and use a new channel list.

White space devices shall incorporate adequate security measures to ensure that they are capable of communicating for purposes of obtaining lists of available channels only with databases operated by administrators authorized by the Commission, and to ensure that communications between white space devices and databases are secure to prevent corruption or unauthorized interception of data. This requirement includes implementing security for communications between Mode I personal portable devices and fixed or Mode II devices for purposes of providing lists of available channels. This requirement applies to communications of channel availability and other spectrum access information between the databases and fixed and Mode II devices (it is not necessary for white space devices to apply security coding to channel availability and channel access information where they are not the originating or terminating device and that they simply pass through).

# 3.2.2.
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Narrowband White Space Devices __ Security __  [desc]
Communications between a Mode I device and a fixed or Mode II device for purposes of obtaining a list of available channels shall employ secure methods that ensure against corruption or unauthorized modification of the data. When a Mode I device makes a request to a fixed or Mode II device for a list of available channels, the receiving device shall check with the white space database that the Mode I device has a valid FCC Identifier before providing a list of available channels. Contact verification signals transmitted for Mode I devices are to be encoded with encryption to secure the identity of the transmitting device. Mode I devices using contact verification signals shall accept as valid for authorization only the signals of the device from which they obtained their list of available channels.

# 3.2.3.

# 3.3.2. Geo-location Requirement
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ Narrowband White Space Devices __ Mobile White Space Devices __ Geo-location Requirement [desc]
A mobile white space device shall incorporate a geo-location capability to determine its geographic coordinates. A mobile white space device may obtain its geographic coordinates through an external geo-location source, provided that source is on the same vehicle or other mobile platform as the mobile device. An external geo-location source may be connected to a mobile device through either a wired or a wireless connection, and a single geo-location source may provide location information to multiple mobile devices on the same mobile platform. An external geo-location source must be connected to a mobile device using a secure connection that ensures that only an external geo-location source that has been approved with a particular mobile device can provide geographic coordinates to that device.

Power limit for devices that rely on sensing. The white space device shall meet the requirements for personal/portable devices in this subpart except that it will be limited to a maximum EIRP of 50 mW per 6 megahertz of bandwidth on which the device operates and it does not have to comply with the requirements for geo-location and database access in § 15.711(b), (d), and (e). Compliance with the detection threshold for spectrum sensing in § 15.717(c), although required, is not necessarily sufficient for demonstrating reliable interference avoidance. Once a device is certified, additional devices that are identical in electrical characteristics and antenna systems may be certified under the procedures of part 2, Subpart J of this chapter.

# 15.717(c)
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ 717(c) [desc]
Sensing requirements—(1) Detection threshold. (i) The required detection thresholds are:
---table begin---
Table tile: Required Detection Thresholds
| Signal Type | Detection Threshold |
|---|---|
| ATSC digital TV signals | ¥114 dBm, averaged over a 6 MHz bandwidth |
| NTSC analog TV signals | ¥114 dBm, averaged over a 100 kHz bandwidth |
| Low power auxiliary, including wireless  microphone, signals | ¥107 dBm, averaged over a 200 kHz bandwidth |
---table end---
(ii) The detection thresholds are referenced to an omnidirectional receive antenna with a gain of 0 dBi. If a receive antenna with a minimum directional gain of less than 0 dBi is used, the detection threshold shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the minimum directional gain of the antenna is less than 0 dBi. Minimum directional gain shall be defined as the antenna gain in the direction and at the frequency that exhibits the least gain. Alternative approaches for the sensing antenna are permitted, e.g., electronically rotatable antennas, provided the applicant for equipment authorization can demonstrate that its sensing antenna provides at least the same performance as an omnidirectional antenna with 0 dBi gain.
(2) Channel availability check time. A white space device may start operating on a TV channel if no TV, wireless microphone or other low power auxiliary device signals above the detection threshold are detected within a minimum time interval of 30 seconds.
(3) In-service monitoring. A white space device must perform in-service monitoring of an operating channel at least once every 60 seconds. There is no minimum channel availability check time for in-service monitoring.
(4) Channel move time. After a TV, wireless microphone or other low power auxiliary device signal is detected on a white space device operating channel, all transmissions by the white space device must cease within two seconds.

(a) Antenna structure. The term antenna structure means a structure that is constructed or used to transmit radio energy, or that is constructed or used for the primary purpose of supporting antennas to transmit and/or receive radio energy, and any antennas and other appurtenances mounted thereon, from the time construction of the supporting structure begins until such time as the supporting structure is dismantled.
(b) Antenna farm area. A geographical location, with established boundaries, designated by the Federal Communications Commission, in which antenna structures with a common impact on aviation may be grouped.
(c) Antenna structure owner. For the purposes of this part, an antenna structure owner is the individual or entity vested with ownership, equitable ownership, dominion, or title.# § 17.4 Antenna structure registration.
(a) The owner of any proposed or existing antenna structure that requires notice of proposed construction to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) due to physical obstruction must register the structure with the Commission. (See § 17.7 for FAA notification requirements.) This includes those structures used as part of stations licensed by the Commission for the transmission of radio energy, or to be used as part of a cable television head end system. If a Federal Government antenna structure is to be used by a Commission licensee, the structure must be registered with the Commission. If the FAA exempts an antenna structure from notification, it is exempt from the requirement that it register with the Commission. (See § 17.7(e) for exemptions to FAA notification requirements.)
(1) For a proposed antenna structure or alteration of an existing antenna structure, the owner must register the structure prior to construction or alteration.
(2) For a structure that did not originally fall under the definition of ‘‘antenna structure,’’ the owner must register the structure prior to hosting a Commission licensee.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each owner of an antenna structure described in paragraph (a) of this section must electronically file FCC Form 854 with the Commission. Additionally, each owner of a proposed structure referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must submit a valid FAA determination of ‘‘no hazard.’’ In order to be considered valid by the Commission, the FAA determination of ‘‘no hazard’’ must not have expired prior to the date on which FCC Form 854 is received by the Commission. The height of the structure will be the highest point of the structure including any obstruction lighting or lightning arrester. If an antenna structure is not required to be registered under paragraph (a) of this section and it is voluntarily registered with the Commission after October 24, 2014, the registrant must note on FCC Form 854 that the registration is voluntary.

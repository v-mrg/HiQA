(c) Parties responsible for equipment compliance should note that the limits specified in this part will not prevent harmful interference under all circumstances. Since the operators of part 15 devices are required to cease operation should harmful interference occur to authorized users of the radio frequency spectrum, the parties responsible for equipment compliance are encouraged to employ the minimum field strength necessary for communications, to provide greater attenuation of unwanted emissions than required by these regulations, and to advise the user as to how to resolve harmful interference problems (for example, see § 15.105(b)).

Susceptibility to interference.
(a) Parties responsible for equipment compliance are advised to consider the proximity and the high power of non-Government licensed radio stations, such as broadcast, amateur, land mobile, and non-geostationary mobile satellite feeder link earth stations, and of U.S. Government radio stations, which could include high-powered radar systems, when choosing operating frequencies during the design of their equipment so as to reduce the susceptibility for receiving harmful interference. Information on non-Government use of the spectrum can be obtained by consulting the Table of Frequency Allocations in § 2.106 of this chapter.
(b) Information on U.S. Government operations can be obtained by contacting: Director, Spectrum Plans and Po# 47 CFR Ch. I (10–1–23 Edition)

# § 15.19 Labeling requirements.
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ 17 __  [desc]
(a) In addition to the requirements in part 2 of this chapter, a device subject to certification, or Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity shall be labeled as follows: 
(1) Receivers associated with the operation of a licensed radio service, e.g., FM broadcast under part 73 of this chapter, land mobile operation under part 90 of this chapter, etc., shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the device: 
This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the condition that this device does not cause harmful interference. 
(2) A stand-alone cable input selector switch, shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the device: 
This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules for use with cable television service. 
(3) All other devices shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the device: 
This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation. 
(4) Where a device is constructed in two or more sections connected by wires and marketed together, the statement specified under paragraph (a) of this section is required to be affixed only to the main control unit. 
(5) When the device is so small or for such use that it is impracticable to label it with the statement specified under paragraph (a) of this section in a font that is four-point or larger, and the device does not have a display that can show electronic labeling, then the information required by this paragraph shall be placed in the user manual and must also either be placed on the device packaging or on a removable label attached to the device. 
(b)–(c) [Reserved] 
(d) Consumer electronics TV receiving devices, including TV receivers, videocassette recorders, and similar devices, that incorporate features intended to be used with cable television service, but do not fully comply with the technical standards for cable ready equipment set forth in § 15.118, shall not be marketed with terminology that describes the device as ‘‘cable ready’’ or ‘‘cable compatible,’’ or that otherwise conveys the impression that the device is fully compatible with cable service. Factual statements about the various features of a device that are intended for use with cable service# § 15.21 Information to user.
The users manual or instruction manual for an intentional or unintentional radiator shall caution the user that changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment. In cases where the manual is provided only in a form other than paper, such as on a computer disk or over the Internet, the information required by this section may be included in the manual in that alternative form, provided the user can reasonably be expected to have the capability to access information in that form.

# § 15.23 Home-built devices.
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ 17 __  [desc]
(a) Equipment authorization is not required for devices that are not marketed, are not constructed from a kit, and are built in quantities of five or less for personal use.
(b) It is recognized that the individual builder of home-built equipment may not possess the means to perform the measurements for determining compliance with the regulations. In this case, the builder is expected to employ good engineering practices to meet the specified technical standards to the greatest extent practicable. The provisions of § 15.5 apply to this equipment.

# § 15.25 Kits.
[desc] RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES __ 17 __  [desc]
A TV interface device, including a cable system terminal device, which is marketed as a kit shall comply with the following requirements:
(a) All parts necessary for the assembled device to comply with the technical requirements of this part must be supplied with the kit. No mechanism for adjustment that can cause operation in violation of the requirements of this part shall be made accessible to the builder.
(b) At least two units of the kit shall be assembled in exact accordance with the instructions supplied with the product to be marketed. If all components required to fully complete the kit (other than those specified in paragraph (a) of this section)# 15.27 Special accessories.
Equipment marketed to a consumer must be capable of complying with the necessary regulations in the configuration in which the equipment is marketed. Where special accessories, such as shielded cables and/or special connectors, are required to enable an unintentional or intentional radiator to comply with the emission limits in this part, the equipment must be marketed with, i.e., shipped and sold with, those special accessories. However, in lieu of shipping or packaging the special accessories with the unintentional or intentional radiator, the responsible party may employ other methods of ensuring that the special accessories are provided to the consumer, without additional charge, at the time of purchase. Information detailing any alternative method used to supply the special accessories shall be included in the application for a gr# 47 CFR Ch. I (10–1–23 Edition)
